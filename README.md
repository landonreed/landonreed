## 👋 Hi, I'm Landon!
I'm a software developer in 🍑 Atlanta, GA (USA).

### 😄 About me 
I work on open source software for public transit agencies. These are some of the projects:

- [Data Tools](https://github.com/ibi-group/datatools-ui) does all things GTFS (manage, validate, deploy)
- [OpenTripPlanner](https://github.com/opentripplanner/opentripplanner) is a multimodal trip planner

Most of my recent experience is in full-stack applications built with Java and React.
